# Titanic-Classification
Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. 
Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries.
These include Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
Loading Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. 
Display the data, handling the missing values, Dropping Column: Check if the 'Cabin' column exists in the dataset. If it does, drop the 'Cabin' column due to many missing values.
Feature Selection: Define the features (X) and the target variable (y) for the machine learning model. The features include columns such as 'Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', etc., and the target variable is 'Survived'.
Data standarization and prediction also in it.
